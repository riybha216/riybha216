- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Riya, an incoming junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science & concentrating in Computer Systems.
- ðŸ’¼ Previously, I was a Software Engineer Intern at [Bloomberg](https://github.com/bloomberg), where I helped develop scalable client workflows on the Bloomberg Terminal in the Foreign Exchange space. Prior to this, I contributed to academia, and was a research intern at San Diego State University, Stanford University, and Fremont STEM (a research facility).
