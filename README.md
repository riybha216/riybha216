Hi there! I'm a fourth-year student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Compuuter Science with a concentration in ML. I'm broadly interested in evals, AI safety, and building scalable data pipelines for AI systems. I've previously contributed in these areas to services such as Microsoft Copilot and Bloomberg's Terminal, as well as projects at various labs.

I'm always happy to chat! You can reach me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riya-bhatia1/) or at riya3bhatia@gmail.com.
