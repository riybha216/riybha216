### Hi there, I'm Riya! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning applications to Natural Language Processing (NLP) + information theory in the non-verbal space.
- ðŸ‘¯  I've worked in the:
            - bioinformatics space, investigating genomic data and compression algorithms
      	- intersection of biology and machine learning, researching pain disorders and teaching machines to understand pain symptoms in people
       	- Natural Language Processing field, optimizing such models by first understanding tokenizations and their efficiency
       	- cryptography sector, decrypting texts written in unknown languages and tracing their origins by using NLP and computer vision
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m learning about information density techniques & advanced statistics currently.
- ðŸ˜„  Pronouns: She/Her
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me about NLP algorithms and when they are used, web development strategies and languages (HTML/CSS/JS), effective algorithm design, and my projects!
