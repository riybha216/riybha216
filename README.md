### Hi there, I'm Riya! 👋

- 🔭  I’m currently working on Natural Language processing and Information Theory research, investigating the information conveyed through the non-verbal channel.
- 👯  I've worked in the: ***bioinformatics space***, investigating genomic data and compression algorithms; ***intersection of biology and machine learning***, researching pain disorders and teaching machines to understand pain symptoms in people; ***Natural Language Processing field***, optimizing such models by first understanding tokenizations and their efficiency; ***cryptography*** sector, decrypting texts written in unknown languages and tracing their origins by using NLP and computer vision.
- 🌱  I’m learning about Information Theory & advanced statistics currently.
- 😄  Pronouns: She/Her
- 💬  Ask me about NLP models, web development strategies and languages (HTML/CSS/JS), effective algorithm design, and my projects!
