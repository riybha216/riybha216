- 👋 Hi there! I'm Riya, an incoming junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Systems.
- 💼 Previously, I was a Software Engineer Intern at [Bloomberg](https://github.com/bloomberg), where I helped develop scalable client workflows on the Bloomberg Terminal. I also contributed to academia, and was a research intern at San Diego State University, Stanford University, and Fremont STEM (a research facility).
- 💻 Currently, I'm building FDetect (patent pending), an ML-powered system to detect fibromyalgia in its early stages. I'm also thrilled to be returning to Bloomberg this summer!
- 💜 Passionate about increasing diversity in tech, ethical ML, and solving challenging problems.
- 📫 Always happy to chat :) --> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riya-bhatia1/) | riyabhat@andrew.cmu.edu
