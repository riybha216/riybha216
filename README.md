<h2>
Hi there, I'm Riya! 👋
</h2>

I'm Riya Bhatia, an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University studying computer science. I'm an avid coder, and I'm currently investigating machine learning methods to produce a rapid and more effective fibromyalgia diagnosis tool. As a programmer, I enjoy solving interdisciplinary problems, as seen by my projects, with ambitious people who have the same goals as me: creating a more safe and equitable world that values collaboration, diversity, and the power of software to create positive change in the way we live.
