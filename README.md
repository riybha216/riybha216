- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Riya, an incoming junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science & concentrating in Computer Systems.
- ðŸ’¼ Previously, I was a Software Engineer Intern at [Bloomberg](https://github.com/bloomberg), where I helped develop scalable client workflows on the Bloomberg Terminal in the Foreign Exchange (FX) space. Before that, I contributed to academia, and was a research intern at San Diego State University, Stanford University, and Fremont STEM (a research facility).
- ðŸ’» Currently, I'm currently building FDetect (patent pending), an ML-powered system to detect fibromyalgia, a pain disorder, in its early stages. I'm also returning to Bloomberg this summer!
- ðŸ’œ Passionate about increasing diversity in tech, ethical ML, and solving challenging problems. And, photography!
- ðŸ“« Always happy to chat :) --> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riya-bhatia1/) | riyabhat@andrew.cmu.edu
